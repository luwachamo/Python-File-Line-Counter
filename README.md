# Python-File-Line-Counter
Counts lines in Python files. Ignores whitespace, triple quote comments, and regular comments.

For a cli version, use pycount

After downloading it, go to its directory and type (on linux):

sudo chmod +x pycount

sudo cp pycount /bin

Then you should be able to type:

pycount YOURFILENAME.py in the directory of your file (or by specifying directory)

Or for all .py files in a directory you can type:

pycount *.py
